# Identity
Name : Ryan Tsany Adelmar (1313623021)

# AI usage
For this assignment, I used ChatGPT and Gemini. I asked the AI to help me understand the basic of Qt Creator.

I used these queries:

- "explain to me the basic of QtCreator"
- "how to center QHBoxLayout items"
- "How to draw a line"
- "Why the line is not showing"
- "What is the geometry meaning of orientation(p, q, r)"
- "is my algorithm correct"

# Collaboration usage
I discussed certain parts of the assignment with some friends to discussed the ideas and concepts of the algorithm. I learned from these discussions how they understood the convex hull and slow convex hull algorithms. I then adapted the ideas into my own implementation, using my own coding style and debugging process. Friends I have discussion with:
- Darren
- Darrell
- Fikri
- Adhitya
- Andris
